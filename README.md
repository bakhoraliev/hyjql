# HyJQL

JQL query builder for Hy and Python.

## What is Hy?

From [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) documentation:

> Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python. Since Hy transforms its Lisp code into Python abstract syntax tree (AST) objects, you have the whole beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form.

## Getting started

Simply add `hyjql` as a dependency to your project:

```bash
pip install hyjql
```
